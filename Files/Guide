There assemblies of all the parts in both a F3D file and a STEP file

These files differ in a few ways from the original versions posted by Panomicron. Further explanation and a build guide for the FDM version will be made... at some point.

The viewfinder is hevily modified for ease of FDM printing, optical elements and the front mask will need to be updated for the focal length of your lens. There is a guide on the Panomicron site and a viewfinder calculator I made linked below (make a copy, there is an example in the calculator). I recomend using Edmound optics lenses, the catalog is wide and easily searchable.
